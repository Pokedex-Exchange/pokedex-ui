[Pokédex](https://pokedex.exchange/) is an automated market maker (“**AMM**”) that allows two tokens to be exchanged using Polkadot's substrate. It is fast, the gas fees are 0, and anyone can participate.

This repo is responsible for the **exchange** interface of the AMM: [pokedex.exchange](https://pokedex.exchange/)
